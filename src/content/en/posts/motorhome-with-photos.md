# Motorhome Travel: Three Families' Experience

Three years ago, we decided with two other families to spend our vacation together during **Semana Santa**, at the end of March - beginning of April, for a week, in motorhomes. We chose motorhomes because of the well-developed infrastructure for them in Spain and the extensive experience of European tourists. We chose our route towards **Portugal**, the southern and western coast, in the Algarve region.

## Preparation and Motorhome Rental

We booked three identical motorhomes through **[Horizon CHM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fHe5cQD4jUsfUwjh8)** company in Malaga. The owner Salvador is a very pleasant Spaniard, **muy recomendable**. He carefully monitors cleanliness: the homes are cleaned with ozone and ultraviolet before rental. The equipment includes: table, four hammock chairs, stools, hose, electricity cord and much more.

The day before departure, we arranged to pick up the homes earlier. Salvador conducted a **detailed briefing**: how to extend the awning, fill and drain water, change the toilet. The home had:
- large double bed for adults,
- additional double bed that lowers from the ceiling,
- small kitchenette with sink, gas stove, refrigerator and TV.

The **refrigerator** worked on gas, external electricity or generator while driving. A full water tank increased the weight to 3.5 tons, requiring truck category license, which we didn't have, so we drove with a half-full tank.

> **Reference:** For motorhomes up to 3.5 tons in Spain, category B license is sufficient. Speed limits: 50/90/100 km/h (city/roads/highways).

## First Impressions and Motorhome Handling

Initially it was **difficult to get used to driving a motorhome**. It's big and heavy, accelerates slower, brakes longer and holds speed worse. In a car you can comfortably drive 120 km/h, but in a motorhome above 100 km/h can be uncomfortable - the cabin starts rattling. On our last trip we had a new motorhome, and 120 km/h felt normal.

Driving a motorhome is a separate art. Initially every turn, every parking requires maximum concentration. The rear camera helps, but the dimensions are still unfamiliar. But after a couple of days you feel like a ship captain - you know every creak, every sound of your temporary home.

## Trip Cost

- Motorhome rental per week: about **1000 euros**
- Diesel and AdBlue: **400–600 euros**  
- Parking: from **free wild** to **20–40 euros per night**

Important: **parking cost doesn't always correspond to its convenience**. Sometimes an expensive parking doesn't offer special services, while a free or cheap one can be much more comfortable.

Motorhome travel budget becomes predictable after the first trip. Main expenses are rental and fuel, everything else depends on your preferences. Want to save - stay at wild parkings, want comfort - pay for campsites with pools and Wi-Fi.

## Practical Tips for Beginners

- **Choosing parkings:** most cannot be booked in advance, better to plan the route and stay in one place for more than one night - this saves energy and time.
- **Parking and unpacking:** motorhome is big, despite cameras and parking sensors minor scratches are possible. Process: park, open windows, arrange furniture and dishes - takes time.
- **Search app:** we use **Park4Night** (iOS and Android), paid subscription - **2 euros per month**. The app shows paid and free parkings with reviews, photos, services and convenient filtering.
- **Tip:** try to choose parkings with fewer people - more comfortable and peaceful.
- **Rest mode:** don't try to change parking every night, it's exhausting. Stay in one place longer so rest really feels like rest.
- **Mutual help:** when parking and unpacking it's more convenient to help each other, since motorhome is a big vehicle, and even with rear cameras sometimes minor incidents happen.

> **Reference:** Park4Night has 6+ million downloads, but many spots are only for day parking. Alternatives: HomeCamper, Portugal Easycamp.

The most important advice - don't rush. Motorhome travel teaches you to slow down, observe the surrounding world. When you stop for two-three days in one place, you start noticing details: how light changes on water throughout the day, what birds come to morning coffee, where locals walk their dogs.

## Favorite Parkings

In southern and western Portugal we tried many parkings, but really liked only a few.

### Parking Among Eucalyptus

Especially want to highlight one parking on the western shore among **eucalyptus trees** ([coordinates](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hg4KuF3rA78AAKxEA)): next to a bison farm, large, almost empty parking. Just us, three families and three motorhomes. Children could observe animals through the fence, and nearby was a steep high rocky shore and ocean. Going down a bit, you could reach a secluded beach - a picturesque place, almost without people, where I even swam despite the season.

### Salema Eco Camp

Another favorite parking - on the southern coast, **Salema Eco Camp**. Eco-camping suitable for tents and motorhomes, has ready-made houses in Indian style. They conduct yoga workshops, children's playground in the form of a ship, restaurant with terrace where you can watch playing children. Minus: road to the beach is not very convenient - either along the road without sidewalk, or long walk.

> **Reference:** Salema Eco Camp - 16 hectares in nature park, prices 16–27 € per night, services: yoga, surfing, playgrounds.

## Wild Parkings and Autonomy

Motorhome autonomy allows **easily staying 1–2 nights at wild parkings without connecting to services**. Solar panels on the roof provide electricity for lighting and device charging, although demanding phones sometimes require connection to electricity at civilized parkings.

You only need to monitor **water consumption** - shower and dishwashing use a lot of water, but generally it's enough. We tried to stay fresh on wild parkings the first night, and after a long stop of 2–3 nights at a civilized parking you can safely spend another night at a wild one.

Wild parking advantages: **free and scenic**, often right by the sea or in pine forest, with short access to ocean. Minus: can't fully use camping amenities - awnings, furniture and barbecue. We did everything quietly, cleaned up at night and looked like ordinary parked vehicles.

> **Reference:** In Portugal since 2021 wild camping is allowed up to 48 hours, but prohibited in Natura 2000 zones. Fines 120–600 euros.

## General Atmosphere and Joint Rest

One of the best moments was that we were all three families with children. We got up together, set up awnings with doors facing each other and placed tables and chairs between motorhomes. In the evening we put children to sleep: they were nearby, under our control, everything audible, entrances controlled, everything safe. We sat quietly, drank wine, talked - it was quite cozy and comfortable.

The format "three families - three motorhomes" turned out to be the perfect balance. Each family has its own space, but we stay together. Children move from one motorhome to another, like between rooms in a big house. Adults can be alone when needed, or gather together at a common table.

Evenings were especially memorable: children play in sand or grass nearby, we cook dinner on several burners simultaneously, share food and wine. Conversations stretch until late night, until the last one says "that's it, we need to get up early tomorrow". Although we almost never get up early - it's vacation after all.

## Conclusion

After three trips we understood: motorhome travel is not a way to see maximum places in minimum time. It's a way to **live** in each place, not just visit it. Wake up by the ocean, have breakfast with mountain views, dine in a pine forest - all this is possible in one day.

The main thing - don't plan too rigid a route, leave time for spontaneity and be ready that the best places are often found by chance. Motorhome gives freedom to stop where you like, and leave when you want. This freedom is the main value of such rest.
