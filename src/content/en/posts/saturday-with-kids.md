That evening mom went out to meet friends, and the three of us stayed at home: me and the kids. Some would go for a walk, some would watch a movie, and we decided to stage… a grand battle with the electronic drums. Well, at some point we had to dismantle and pack them to sell later.

I assigned roles: Luka was our chief box master, Agniya — the assistant in charge of bolts and drums, and I — the commander-in-chief of the whole operation.

Luka took the task seriously: he grabbed the tape, unfolded a box and started taping it up. Unfortunately, he taped the top. And the bottom, which was supposed to neatly click into place by itself, remained open. The box looked like a person who put a hat on their feet and is now very proud of themselves. But Luka didn’t spare the tape — on the inside everything shone as if the box had gone to a beauty salon for a full body wrap.

Meanwhile, Agniya decided to show true German order. While I was dealing with the large parts, she disassembled everything down to the last screw. On the sofa, bolts, washers and nuts lined up in tidy rows. It seemed that if you photographed it, you’d get a catalog called “Young Watchmaker.” It looked beautiful, but it didn’t make my life easier. Instead of packing the drums in large pieces, I now had to figure out where each washer came from and where, in fact, it should go back.

Then I realized: we wouldn’t cope without outside help. I launched YouTube and found an unboxing video of these very drums. I sat there and, in reverse order, step by step, tried to reconstruct the picture of “how it was.” I felt like a detective investigating a crime against common sense.

In the meantime, the kids got tired and asked to watch a movie. But before that, Agniya decided to shine with her housekeeping skills one last time:
— Dad, I’ll make popcorn!
And she ran to the kitchen.

Ten minutes later, at the tensest moment of the investigation, Agniya runs in, in tears:
— Dad, I ruined everything!

Turns out she decided to make popcorn and film a video about it. But she got a little carried away: cranked the heat to maximum and left the pan to the bitter end. The popcorn, instead of “pop-pop,” went “shhh” and turned into charcoal lumps that fused to the pan. It was no longer a pan, but a volcano after an eruption.

The two of us armed ourselves with a grill set and scraped for two hours. We felt like archaeologists excavating ancient civilizations — only instead of gold we found pieces of blackened popcorn. At times it seemed that if you tapped the pan, you could hear an echo: “why would you do this to me, girl…”

When the pan came back to life, we looked at the clock. There was almost no time left. No movie for sure — and no new batch of popcorn either. There were only a few minutes for dinner. So Agniya quickly boiled sausages, I reheated some pasta — and that’s how we had dinner.

But together. With the hat-box, the parade of tiny screws, the popcorn archaeology and the reverse unboxing. And you know what I realized? It’s exactly these evenings that you later remember with a smile.
