# Family Trip Around Spain: When Plans Meet Reality

*Two weeks, one car, four people and a round-Spain journey around the entire perimeter of the country*

August is the perfect time for vacation, especially when you have two weeks of freedom and the whole family is ready for adventure. My wife, two kids and I loaded the car to the brim (as usually happens on family trips - it seems like you're only taking the essentials, but the trunk ends up bursting at the seams) and set off from our home in Málaga towards Salamanca.

Everything was planned perfectly: cozy apartments in the heart of the historic center, where every stone breathes history. But as they say, the devil is in the details...

## First Travel Lesson: Google Maps Doesn't Know Everything

Right before departure, I decided to double-check the location of our apartment. And then I got a surprise! It turns out our accommodation was in a restricted traffic zone - the very one where ordinary mortals in cars can only enter with special permits.

Picture this: I'm sitting with my phone, frantically searching for parking in Salamanca, while the family is already sitting in the car, ready to leave. The kids ask: "Dad, when are we going?" and I think: "Good question..."

Fortunately, the apartment owner turned out to be understanding - she offered a parking space for 12 euros per day. The most budget-friendly option available! Of course, parking in a public lot would have been much easier, but also significantly more expensive. So 12 euros for peace of mind and convenience was an excellent offer.

## Road Through the Apocalypse: When Vacation Turns Into a Disaster Movie

The owner promised to register us on a special city website for entry into the restricted traffic zone. She promised... but couldn't confirm whether she had actually done it. Classic situation: "Don't worry, everything will be fine!" she says, while you think: "Fine for whom exactly?"

With this healthy dose of uncertainty, we set off on our 6-hour march to Salamanca. But fate decided to add some drama to our journey...

What we saw on the road looked more like filming a post-apocalyptic movie than a family vacation. Unprecedented forest fires were raging throughout Spain at that moment, and we were "lucky" enough to drive right through these zones.

The road turned into a surreal journey: on one side - stunning Spanish landscapes, on the other - scenes from a horror movie. The roadsides were littered with charred remains of vegetation, farms looked like sets for an end-of-the-world movie, and thick smoke periodically covered the road, as if we were driving through dense fog.

![Fires on the road](/images/aroundSpain2025/Fire)

I quickly realized that the air conditioning needed to be switched to recirculation - otherwise the car interior would fill with smoke. The children fell silent by the windows, mesmerized by this natural show, while my wife and I exchanged glances with the expression "What a vacation we chose for ourselves!"

The most impressive (and alarming) moments were when we saw living tongues of flame on the mountainsides along the road. The sun kept turning into a dark red disk, like in horror movies, and the whole world took on some alien, bloody hue.

## Salamanca: When 20 Meters Becomes Infinity

And so, after six hours of driving through smoking Spain, we finally arrived in Salamanca. The contrast was striking: after the apocalyptic landscapes of the road, we found ourselves in an idyll - an incredibly calm, clean and tidy town that looked like a postcard picture.

We stopped with hazard lights on the edge of the historic zone (the owner supposedly arranged the permit, but who knows...) and set off on foot to look for our apartment. Fortunately, it was found quickly and turned out to be very close - inside the historic zone, literally a couple of minutes' walk from where the car was parked.

### Welcome to the Stone Sauna

The first impression of Salamanca was... unforgettable. +36°C, and the entire historic center, built of beautiful stone, turned into a giant natural sauna. The air was dry and scorching, and literally smelled like a sauna! Walking through these ancient streets was like strolling inside an oven decorated with architectural masterpieces.

### Google Maps vs Medieval Streets: 0:1

Leaving the family to rest in the cool apartment, I took the parking keys and set off to re-park the car. And then the real quest began!

It turns out that Google Maps and other navigators simply give up when it comes to historic centers. They honestly take you to the edge of the pedestrian zone, and then draw an elegant arc with a hint: "Well, that's it, you're on your own from here!"

My parking was located some 15-20 meters from where I left the car. TWENTY METERS! But these 20 meters were separated from me by a "no entry" sign - that sacred boundary that ordinary mortals in cars don't cross.

At first, I decided to act naively and straightforwardly: I simply entered the historic center, following the signs, hoping to intuitively reach the parking. The result? I exited exactly where I entered, describing a perfect circle and not getting a centimeter closer to the coveted parking.

### Operation "Parking": Second and Third Rounds

Not giving up (or maybe out of desperation), I decided to use high technology against medieval streets. Sitting in the comfortable air-conditioned cabin, I opened Google Maps in satellite mode and started playing detective, tracing a route through the maze of streets with my finger on the screen.

The plan seemed perfect: a big detour through the new town, entry into the old part from a completely different side, and triumphant arrival at the parking! I drove around, entered the historic center from the other end. The streets became narrower and more crooked, tourists - more numerous (they looked at me with slight bewilderment in their eyes). And here it is, the moment of truth! I'm almost at the goal, just 10-15 meters left to the coveted parking entrance, and then... BAM! A fence. Temporary barriers. Construction work. Information I couldn't know in advance and which isn't reflected on any map in the world.

The third attempt from the opposite side also failed. By this point, after a 6-hour drive and several failed attempts, my strength left me, and I just stopped with hazard lights near the market.

### Meeting the Locals

BEEP! Immediately a taxi driver's horn sounded behind me, displeased with my creative parking.

"Señor, this place is only for taxis!" he began scolding me sternly.

"Sorry, friend," I exhaled, "I don't know where to go. I'm confused, tired, lost... Please help!"

The Spanish heart softened, and the taxi driver began explaining the route. When verbal explanations didn't help, he confidently pointed his finger at Google Maps: "Right here!"

I looked closer: "Buddy, but that's just a house between two streets..."

The taxi driver looked at the map again, frowned: "Strange... there should be another street between this one and that one... Why isn't it on Google Maps?"

In the end, he suggested a route with almost a 360° turn, which led... right, almost to the same point where I started.

### Final Boss: The Man-Eating Elevator

Fortunately, the taxi driver was a man of his word! After almost an hour of parking adventures, I finally found myself at the coveted goal. Before me stood large iron doors of a car elevator in an old building.

The key fob called the elevator and opened the doors, but they didn't have presence sensors built in! They periodically decided to slam shut, completely uninterested in the fact that there was a car with a nervous driver inside.

One hand on the steering wheel, the other frantically pressing the button on the key fob, trying to convince the elevator that I haven't finished entering yet! I even had to fold the side mirror.

But finally I was in the elevator - a strange feeling, riding an elevator while sitting behind the wheel of a car! I had conquered medieval Salamanca and its modern technological traps.

## Dream Apartment and the Game of "Find the Frog"

Our apartment turned out to be simply perfect - in the very heart of the historic center, literally two steps from the university and its famous main facade. And it's famous because among the richest carved decorations of the 16th century, a small frog on a skull is hidden - a local easter egg that has been entertaining tourists and students for 500 years.

![Ramen in Salamanca](/images/aroundSpain2025/Salamanca-ramen.jpg)

By tradition, if you find the frog without outside help, you'll have luck in studies and exams. We gladly joined this centuries-old game.

We had breakfast in trendy hipster coffee shops, of which there are quite a few. In general, the atmosphere of a university town and centuries-old intellectual cultural capital is very strongly felt in the city.

Over two days we saw two cathedrals, the episcopal residence with an unexpectedly interesting exhibition of Catholic and contemporary art, and the Roman bridge with the legendary Celtiberian bull.

![Episcopal residence of Salamanca](/images/aroundSpain2025/Salamanca-episcop.jpg)

Particularly impressive was the **Anaya Chapel** (Chapel of San Bartolomé) in the Old Cathedral, where **Don Diego de Anaya Maldonado** rests, Archbishop of Seville and founder of the College of San Bartolomé, who died in 1437. His statue lies with open eyes, creating a mesmerizing and slightly eerie impression - it feels like he's watching all the visitors. His tomb is surrounded by an elegant Gothic grille from the 16th century.

![Cathedral of Salamanca](/images/aroundSpain2025/Salamanca-cathedral)

And also in this same **Anaya Chapel** a unique 14th-century organ is preserved, still painted in original colors and still working! Imagine: the instrument is almost 700 years old, and it still sounds.

Also memorable was the **Chapel of San Martín** (Chapel del Aceite - Oil Chapel) with the tomb of Bishop **Rodrigo Díaz**, who died in 1339.

Salamanca was absolutely beautiful with its student spirit, and I even started thinking it was the best city in Spain (among those without sea, of course), but it was time to move on...

## Asturias: From Medieval Stones to Cow Bells

After two eventful days in Salamanca, we said goodbye to this amazing city and headed north - to Asturias, where our friends Vitaly and Polina Shemetov were waiting for us. They bought an excellent duplex for an incredibly low price in a small town near Gijón.

![Vitaly and Polina Shemetov's duplex](/images/aroundSpain2025/Shemetovy)

Their house is very conveniently located: the ocean is within reach, Gijón is 25 minutes by car, but at the same time the windows offer a beautiful view of nature and greenery. And the most charming thing - a cow with a bell that leisurely strolls in the mornings, creating the perfect soundtrack to an Asturian morning. After the stone sauna of Salamanca, it was like moving to a pastoral idyll of green northern Spain.

### Gijón and an Unexpected Guest from Madrid

We spent an excellent, fun dinner with the Shemetovs, sang with a guitar, had a heartfelt chat about life in Spain and future plans. And the next morning we already had a planned meeting with my colleague from "AI Garage".

![Gijón](/images/aroundSpain2025/Gijon)

With **Roma T.** we met in a trendy coffee shop in Gijón and walked around this wonderful city, which amazes with its combination of luxury, relaxation and stunning ocean views. Gijón somehow manages to simultaneously breathe the atmosphere of a fairly prosperous life while remaining a relaxed seaside town. We went to a beach with a trail where eucalyptus trees grow and incredible ocean views open up - the contrast with yesterday's heat of Salamanca and the fresh ocean breeze was stunning.

![Eucalyptus trail](/images/aroundSpain2025/Gijon-Eucaliptes)

After the walks, we went to Roma T.'s home in a new urbanization. And here we had a completely unexpected surprise! Another colleague of mine came for dinner - **Roma G.** in his Tesla straight from Madrid! Imagine: a person covered several hours of road just to sit with us, have dinner, chat. That's what real friendship means!

And then we organized real "fun starts" - test-drove different cars. The most interesting was comparing **Roma G.'s old, well-traveled Tesla** with **Roma T.' brand new Tesla**. The contrast was impressive: one car with traces of numerous travels against practically showroom shine.
Although, turning on turn signals with buttons on the steering wheel seemed too innovative to me!
Well, we also rode a bit in my **Touran** - a family car after sporty electric cars seemed like a completely different world.

Roma G., despite all our persuasions to stay the night, set off on the return journey to Madrid in his battered but faithful Tesla - I think he got home well after midnight. Amazing person!

## Cantabria: Road to the Edge of the World

The next morning, after having coffee at Roma T.' favorite cafe (owned by Russian-speaking guys), we continued further to Cantabria to the Zamilov family in the village of **Arredondo**.

![Arredondo](/images/aroundSpain2025/Arredondo)

This turned out to be an incredibly picturesque village with a population of about 470 people, but with a very interesting history! Arredondo is known as **"La Capital del Mundo"** (The Capital of the World) - the village got such a proud name thanks to a large number of **"indianos"** - residents who left for America in the 19th and early 20th centuries, got rich there and returned to Spain. The main local "indianos" - **Antonio Gutiérrez Solana**, **Antonio Trueba Barcín** and **Francisco Masa Abascal** - financed the construction of the church, school and other beautiful buildings in the town.

The road to this "capital of the world" became a real adventure. Cantabria is not the most densely populated region of Spain, and we turned off successively less and less populated roads. First a regular highway, then regional roads, then completely deserted terrain began, and the road went into the mountains in serpentines.

![Road to Arredondo](/images/aroundSpain2025/Arredondo-road.jpg)

Somewhere at the very top, already close to the pass, we were met by a donkey on the roadside! I joked that we could stop, open the side window and take him with us to visit the Zamilovs. And the view from there was fantastic - we were practically above the clouds, and all of Cantabria lay as if in the palm of your hand, incredibly picturesque, with views of the ocean.

![Views from the Zamilovs' house](/images/aroundSpain2025/Arredondo-view)

The Zamilovs have an excellent three-story house right in the center of the village, large and spacious. But, as they told us, such a house is a huge responsibility and work to maintain. It creates the feeling that you can only live by working on improving the house and maintaining it.

![Mountain hike](/images/aroundSpain2025/Arredondo-hike)

We walked with **Bulat** in the mountains and nearby places, with **Raisa** around the village. This is really secluded living: there's a therapist (who works periodically), a pharmacy and a small shop - practically everything! The village lives a seasonal life: in summer more people come as to summer houses, in winter it's quite deserted, but incredibly beautiful in this valley surrounded by mountains.

## Logroño: Where August Turns Into October

![Road to Logroño](/images/aroundSpain2025/Bilbao-road.jpg)

After saying goodbye to the "capital of the world" and its wonderful inhabitants, we continued further south. We stopped for lunch in **Logroño**, the capital of the **La Rioja** region - Spain's famous wine region.

![Logroño](/images/aroundSpain2025/Logrono.jpg)

And here we had a real climate shock! August 22, 3 PM, and it was only **+19°C** there! Imagine: while all of Spain was melting in August heat, we, already accustomed to Spanish temperatures, were putting on sweaters in the middle of summer. As if we moved from August to October in a couple of hours of driving.

## Zaragoza: When Rumors Don't Come True

That evening **Zaragoza** awaited us. Honestly, I had heard not very good reviews about this city: that it's boring there, nothing to do, just enterprises, constant rains. All this turned out to be completely untrue!

![Ramen in Zaragoza](/images/aroundSpain2025/Zaragoza-ramen.jpg)

In our impressions, Zaragoza appeared as a very quiet, calm, non-touristy, but very pleasant big city. The funniest thing - people in the city center were dressed to the nines, festively, like in good districts of Madrid. And we in shorts and t-shirts felt a bit out of place - as if we got to a social party in beach clothes!

![Zaragoza](/images/aroundSpain2025/Zaragoza-fun)

And what luck with the hotel! For **84 euros per night** (cheaper than all other places in our trip) we were given not just a family room, but a whole apartment! We had a living room with a sofa, armchair and TV, a bedroom, and to all this was added through a door another full standard hotel room with its own bathroom, which the children occupied. And in our bathroom there was a **jacuzzi**! After a long day on the road, we all rested excellently, lay in bubbles and recharged with energy.

![Views of Zaragoza](/images/aroundSpain2025/Zaragoza)

In the **Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar** we learned an amazing story: this is the first temple in Christianity dedicated to the Virgin Mary, who is the patroness of all Spanish-speaking peoples. Inside hang flags of all Latin American countries, Spain, and for some reason Portugal, Brazil and even the USA - a symbol of the unity of the Spanish-speaking world.

Believers line up for special ribbons testifying to completed pilgrimage. And there also hang two real aviation bombs from the Civil War of 1936 - none of the four dropped on the cathedral exploded! They were left as a sign of the miracle that occurred.

It's a pity that we had very little time in Zaragoza - we even regretted staying only one night.

## El Masnou: Catalan Quality

![Road to Barcelona](/images/aroundSpain2025/Barcelona.jpg)

After a luxurious night in Zaragoza, we headed to **El Masnou**, a suburb of Barcelona, where our friends the **Loskutovs** were waiting for us. We spent 4 days with them - the longest stop in our journey.

![El Masnou](/images/aroundSpain2025/ElMasnou)

El Masnou pleasantly surprised us with its high quality of life: excellent Catalan food stores with great presentation, good restaurants. You can see that Catalans approach life arrangement thoroughly, even in the suburbs.

![Supermarket in El Masnou](/images/aroundSpain2025/ElMasnou-food)

Together with the Loskutovs we spent a lot of great time! We went to a park with a labyrinth... though there was no labyrinth there - it was under repair, they had demolished it all and promised to return it only later. Classic tourist surprise! But we went to a historic water park and had a great time there, rode the slides, ate deliciously.

![Park in El Masnou](/images/aroundSpain2025/ElMasnou-playground)

We weren't lucky with the Chinese buffet - they greeted us familiarly and started serving us poorly. Apparently, they decided that tourists with children would tolerate everything. We didn't even have lunch there, just left. But we organized an excellent **barbecue on the plot** near the house - as they say, the best restaurant is a grill in good company in the fresh air.

![Park with labyrinth in Barcelona](/images/aroundSpain2025/Barcelona-labirynth.jpg)

## Home Through Valencia

How quickly these vacation days flew by! After saying goodbye to dear friends in El Masnou, we set off on the last leg of our round-Spain journey. The last overnight stay was to be in the vicinity of **Valencia**.

![Valencia](/images/aroundSpain2025/Valencia)

I found a hotel acceptable in price and quality, though in the suburbs. First we walked around Valencia itself, ate delicious ramen (yes, ramen again - we had already become experts in Asian cuisine in Spain!).

![Ramen in Valencia](/images/aroundSpain2025/Valencia-ramen)

In the store we witnessed a real one-act theater: gypsy women with children were stealing and hiding goods in numerous pockets, while an employee stopped them, made them take everything out and kicked them out in shame. Such scenes from life are remembered more than some attractions.

![Our hotel in Valencia](/images/aroundSpain2025/Valencia-hotel)

Our little hotel turned out to be quite unusual, but new, clean and quality. **Modular structure**: inner courtyard, gallery, and all rooms open directly into this gallery, into the inner courtyard with a **pool** and breakfast room. Such architecture is more reminiscent of Latin American haciendas.

## Home to Málaga

And finally, after a few more hours on the road, we're **home in Málaga**!

This is an amazing feeling that every traveler knows: **it's good to visit, but home is better**. Two weeks of incredible adventures - from the smoking fires of the first day to parking quests in medieval cities, from ocean breezes of Asturias to Catalan barbecue, from aviation bombs in Zaragoza cathedral to gypsy dramas in Valencia store.

We drove almost the entire perimeter of Spain, met old friends in different corners of the country, discovered new places, experienced many funny and not-so-funny situations, but most importantly - we spent these two weeks as a whole family, creating memories that will delight us until the next big journey.

*Travel teaches us that plans are just a starting point for real adventures. The main thing is to be ready for surprises and find in them not problems, but new stories to tell.*
